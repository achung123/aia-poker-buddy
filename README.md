This repository is home for the source code of the Poker Buddy. This is the hardware interace for the All In Analytics project. This interface provides users with a small IoT device that allows them to track poker hands in real-time. It uses RFID based cards that generate unique signatures and allows users to store hands in the All In Analytics Core system.
